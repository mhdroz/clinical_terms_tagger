Code acccompanying the following manuscript: **Leveraging MedDRA Biomedical Terminology and Weak Labeling for Medical Concepts Extraction from CLinical Notes**



> __Usability note:__ This is experimental work, not a directly usable software library.
The code was developed in the context of an academic research project, highly
exploratory and iterative in nature. It is published here in the spirit of
open science and reproducibility values.


## Getting started


### Prerequisite
What to install and how to instal them
- Instructions to get the meddra terminology and which files are needed to build the tagger
- Instructions for where to find the base termino for WL
- Packages to install

This code uses the [MedDRA](https://www.meddra.org) terminology as source for clinical concepts extraction. In order to use the terminology, a [subscritpion](https://www.meddra.org/how-to-use/support-documentation/english/welcome) is needed. Once access to the terminology files have been granted, concatenate all single level files into one terminology file for the creation of the tagger and save the terminology file in res/. 

```
Give examples
```

## How to run
Describe each step for a successful run:
1. tag the documents (include tagger creation if does not already exist)
3. weak labeling extractions
4. cleaning extractions

_include an example with a dummy termino and open source notes_

1. Update the paths and file names in HP.py. In the src/ directory, run the following command:
```
nohup python meddra_extract.py --task 'tag' --label_model 'label_model' --threads 28 --datasource local > extract_meddra.out&
```
2. Once the tagging has finished, in the project directory, run the following command:
```
python setup_wl.py start_idx end_idx > wl.out&
```
3. Finally, to eliminate double occurrences of composite terms, in the same project directory, run:
```
python setup_cleaning.py start_idx end_idx n_threads > clean.out&
```
